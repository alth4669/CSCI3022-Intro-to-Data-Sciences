    "The simulation estimated the probability that the rolled values would be close to one another is 0.44635 after rolling the dice 100,000 times. This differed slightly from the predicted probability at 10,000 or 50,000 simulations. However it is reasonably close. The accuracy could be improved by adding more rolls, but this greatly increases the time required to perform the total simulation. 100,000 times seemed reasonable."

    "**Part C**: In the in-class notebook associated with Lecture 4 (nb04) we plotted a running estimate of the probability of an event as a function of the number of trials in our simulation.  Write code to run at least 10 independent simulations of at least 50,000 trials each to estimate $P(C)$ and plot their running estimate curves on the same set of axes. **Hint**: This is a lot of computation, so try to leverage Numpy as much as possible so that your code doesn't run forever.

    "In every homework assignment we'll give you a Challenge Problem.  Challenge Problems never need to be turned in (and in fact, will not be graded) but we encourage you to give them a shot (after completing the required homework problems) and discuss them with your classmates and your instructors. \n",
    "\n",
    "This Challenge Problem was a [Riddler](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/) on [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com) a few years back. \n",

    "You’re on the north shore of a river, and want to cross to the south, via a series of 13 bridges and six islands, which you can see in the diagram below. But, as you approach the water, night falls, a bad storm rolls in, and you’re forced to wait until morning to try to cross. Overnight, the storm could render some of the bridges unusable — it has a 50 percent chance of knocking out each of the bridges. (The chance is independent for each bridge.)\n",
